# About me

Hello, I am **Junbeom Lee**üëã.

I am a software developer specializing in Python backend engineering, with a strong interest in machine learning and data. 

For three years, I worked as a teacher in South Korea while pursuing programming as a hobby.
However, my dream of creating impactful services for people led me to leave teaching and pursue a career in software development.
Recently, I moved to Montreal, Canada to realize my goal of becoming an engineer in North America. 

I am open to any opportunities where I can demonstrate my potential as a software engineer. 

Here is my [**Resume**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8XSD4pxiQg8PPT66fUnIxx5Brg0v6-V/view?usp=sharing)
